item.ranged_weapon.description.crossbow
A shooting weapon often used by militias, can be very dangerous. A bolt from a high quality crossbow can pierce plate armor.

Another weapon which origins vanish in the mists of time. A slingshot allows to cast rocks or any similar projectile at the enemy.

You're not in a hurry to get fully cured, are you? If you have some patience - this potion is for you!

Another drink which you'd be better off not drinking - unless you want to make the monsters' job easier.

item.potion.description.weakness
A slump can be frustrating - to avoid it it'd be better to throw this mixture out. Consuming it decreases the power of your spells and strokes.

item.magicweapon.name.runic_sword
Runic sword

item.meleeweapon.description.knife
Although it is usually used as a very useful, comprehensive tool, it can be turned into a weapon as well.

item.meleeweapon.description.dagger
Longer than a knife, a weapon of assassins and rogues, perfect for doing the so-called â€˜quiet job,' or for fighting in narrow passages.

item.meleeweapon.description.sword
Weapons of various lengths can be contained within this category, but they are usually characterised by a straight blade, and a grip with a crossguard for parrying attacks. A sword was often a symbol of status and high position in hierarchy of its wielder.

item.meleeweapon.description.serrated_sword
You'll have more than one opportunity to check this original weapon's efficacy. As fantastic as some of the beasts you will confront.

item.meleeweapon.description.club
Anyone can see how a club looks like. Its purpose is to hit - when you hit somebody's head with it they might be stunned. The maker of this club is said to have promised that no other shall come close to it when it comes to stunning.

item.meleeweapon.description.axe
This axe was first found close to a carcass of a giant boar. The fact that there was not a single drop of blood on the blade might suggest that the previous owner might have a bit overestimated his ability to throw a weapon of this kind at enemies.

item.meleeweapon.description.double_axe
This two-handed axe with two blades is a terrifying, formidable weapon of which only the strongest warrior may take full advantage. It decisively deserved its name.

item.meleeweapon.description.spear
One of the oldest weapons in the world, however its efficiency can be confirmed by the fact that it is still used as a weapon, and not only by some meager squads. This spear was blessed by the God of War to, in his honor, hit the enemies accurately and powerfully.

item.meleeweapon.description.halberd
This weapon looks like a hybrid of a spear and an axe, interfusing the advantages of both. Known for being a weapon of city police, the halberd may become a dangerous tool in the hand of an experienced warrior.

item.meleeweapon.description.lance
A wooden weapon associated with horse-riding knights, used for breaking the opponent arrays during the charges of cavalry.

item.meleeweapon.description.pique
Longer than a spear, works optimally in a compact infantry array as a defensive weapon. The combat style of pikemen relates to the ancient tactics of hoplits and falangists.

item.meleeweapon.description.long_stick
Long sticks of this kind are most often associated with wandering mages or pilgrims, and thanks to their length and versatility they allow for keeping the opponent in a distance.

item.meleeweapon.description.hammer
Stone is heavy, and so is the hammer. That means a stone hammer must be a cursedly heavy and slow weapon which could be used only by someone with supernatural strength.

item.magicweapon.description.runic_sword
This perfectly forged and balanced sword has a slot for insertion of a magical rune that will provide it with some additional, special properties. Even without it it's a fast and valued weapon.

Two slices of bread and ingredients of different types between them. The sandviches differ from each other as much as people do.

item.food.description.apple
Dang it, the apple-tree which gave birth to this fruit must have been bred by giants! This fruit sized as a pumpkin obviously contains all the nutritional values of an apple.

item.food.description.beer
There are hundreds of beer genres, even though nobody is sure what is brewed in this dungeon. Or maybe it's imported? All you need to do is to try this popular intoxicant.

item.food.description.hot_dog
A wiener in a bun with salad. Of course it is the best if it's warm.

item.food.description.hamburger
A cutlet surrounded with a roll from both sides, very magnificent. Multiplicity of supplements makes your heart and stomach happier.

item.food.description.baguette

To paddle one's own canoe... and to cure your own wounds! This rune releases a wave of healing energy that seals up your wounds and replenishes your stamina.

item.spell.description.firebolt
A clichÃ© among the offensive spells of enchantment adepts. Although it doesn't deal too much damage, it can be used very frequently.

item.spell.description.iceBullet

item.spell.description.uncurse
This spell effaces the negative consequences of curses casted at you and provides a temporary resistance against them.
